## Stack
Spincord is a Typescript and NodeJS app that authenticates with the Spincord [Discord bot user](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-) using [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). The [Discogs REST API](https://www.discogs.com/developers) is used to query for album, artist, and marketplace data. The source is linted with eslint, unit tested with JEST, and uses GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD.
