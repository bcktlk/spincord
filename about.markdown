At its core, Spincord is a [Discogs](https://discogs.com) client that works right inside your [Discord](https://discord.com) server; it's built by music nerds, for music nerds. Spincord is here for to add easy to use and powerful music database search tools to your casual music and vinyl related discussions. Friends not sure what album you're talking about? Hit 'em with a `!album` to instantly link to a full-on Discogs Release. Having trouble describing what the cover of [Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells](https://www.discogs.com/Mike-Oldfield-Tubular-Bells/release/1387070) looks like? `!albumart tubular bells`. It's that easy.
