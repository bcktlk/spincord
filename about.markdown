At its core, Spincord is a [Discogs](https://discogs.com) client that works right inside your [Discord](https://discord.com) server; it's built by music nerds, for music nerds. Spincord is here for to add easy to use and powerful music database search tools to your casual music and vinyl related discussions. Friends not sure what album you're talking about? Hit 'em with a `/album` to instantly link to a full-on Discogs Release. Having trouble describing what the cover of [Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells](https://www.discogs.com/Mike-Oldfield-Tubular-Bells/release/1387070) looks like? `/albumart tubular bells`. It's that easy.


### Using Spincord
Discogs queries with Spincord are designed to be natural and easy. Type one of the bot commands followed by something you would type into a search bar (specifically like the one you'd find at discogs.com). Spincord does all the searching, formatting, etc and then just hits you and your friends up with that hyper-relevant info you were after. More commands are being added to Spincord all the time and you can always get the most up-to-date list by typing in `/` and browsing the available commands under the Spincord record icon.

* `/album [album name]` where [album name] is just your best guess at an album name, has Spincord post a Discogs link to the most relevant release it can find
* `/albumart [album name]` posts the album art most closely related to what you typed in for [album name]
* `/pricecheck [album name]` will find the lowest price that album is currenlty going for on the Discogs Marketplace (plus a link)
* `/artistinfo [artist name]` gets a url to the listing of a given artist
* `/artistpic [artist name]` gets the picture of a given artist
